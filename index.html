        <p id="lit"> In a pub on the south side of Dublin last night, the talk wasn’t about hurling or Gaelic football for once—it
        was all about the New York Knicks. I swear on me mother’s brown bread, every lad at the bar was convinced this
        is finally their year. The Knicks are charging like a runaway horse, and if you ask any of us, we’ll tell you
        straight: the blue and orange are marching toward glory, and we’re ready to raise a pint to it.</p>

    <h2>Glorious King James</h2>
    <p>And then, as sure as rain in November, the conversation turned to LeBron James. “Ah, King LeBron,” one fella
        said, lifting his glass with <span class = "redtext">it's all a out the mets baby lets go mets</span> reverence, “the man’s ruling the court like he was born with a crown glued to his
        head.” Now, when the boys jokingly say he’s “everybody’s daddy,” they’re just having a laugh about how he still
        dominates the league—full-grown athletes bouncing off him like toddlers off a trampoline.</p>

        <p>But the loudest shouts of the night came when college football entered the chat. The moment someone mentioned
        Georgia, the whole pub erupted <span>It's all about the mets baby lets go mets</span>like it was New Year’s Eve. “The Dawgs are takin’ it again!” a lad bellowed from
        across the room. And truth be told, with the way they’re playing, you’d nearly believe it yourself. Between the
        Knicks’ rise, LeBron’s reign, and Georgia’s march toward another title, it was a grand night for bold
        predictions—and even grander for the craic that came with them.</p>
